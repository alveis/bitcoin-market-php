	  					Disadvantages:

    The worth of the coins fluctuates.
    Not as mainstream as other options (CC, Paypal).

The advantages all follow a similar pattern, in that because there is no central authority, anyone can use it at any time without needing any confirmations or acceptance, plus the fees are pretty low.

Now the disadvantages are varied. Since it is not as mainstream as other payment options, I don't think it is quite where it needs to be, in order to make it your only payment option. But by all means, if you are a huge supporter and want this to grow, you can be a Bitcoin-only service, but I would suggest, for now, using it alongside another service, which accepts credit card.

The other disadvantage is the stability of Bitcoin's value; at the beginning of this year, the worth of one bitcoin was around 12-14$ each, in just a couple of months the coins went up to almost 240$ in April and are currently worth around 110-115$ each. This is in huge contrast to traditional currencies, for your money to have a 2000% increase in worth and then a 50% decrease, all within a few months seems like it should be a red flag.
